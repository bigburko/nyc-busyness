Different businesses need different time periods for optimal foot traffic analysis:

MORNING BUSINESSES (7AM-11AM):
- Coffee shops, breakfast spots, professional services
- Target: morning commuters, remote workers, early meetings
- Time Periods: ["morning"] or ["morning", "afternoon"]

LUNCH BUSINESSES (11AM-3PM):
- Casual dining, quick service, business lunch spots
- Target: office workers, tourists, shopping crowds
- Time Periods: ["afternoon"] or ["morning", "afternoon"]

EVENING/DINNER BUSINESSES (5PM-11PM):
- Restaurants, bars, entertainment, date spots
- Target: after-work crowd, social dining, nightlife
- Time Periods: ["evening"] or ["afternoon", "evening"]

ALL-DAY BUSINESSES:
- Pizza, casual dining, convenience, tourist spots
- Target: diverse crowd throughout day
- Time Periods: ["morning", "afternoon", "evening"]

NIGHTLIFE BUSINESSES (9PM-2AM):
- Bars, clubs, late-night dining, speakeasies
- Target: nightlife crowd, weekend socializers
- Time Periods: ["evening"] ONLY

24-HOUR BUSINESSES:
- Diners, convenience stores, late-night services
- Target: shift workers, insomniacs, travelers

${!hasEthnicities ? `

→ Set ethnicity weight to 0.0

→ Reasoning: "No ethnic targeting specified, focusing on age and income demographics"` : `
✅ ETHNICITIES SELECTED: ${currentState!.selectedEthnicities!.join(', ')}
→ Can use ethnicity weighting (0.3-0.6 depending on business cultural importance)
→ Strategy: ethnicity (0.4-0.6), age (0.25-0.35), income (0.1-0.25), gender (0.05-0.1)`}

HERITAGE BUSINESS SPECIAL LOGIC:
For authentic/traditional/cultural businesses:
→ If ethnicity available: Heavy ethnicity weight (0.6)
→ If ethnicity unavailable: age (0.6) + income (0.3) + reasoning about using age as cultural proxy
→ Always prioritize established cultural neighborhoods over new developments`;
